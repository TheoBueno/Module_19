# Module_19
 Shopping Cart Exe

#  Title of the Repository: Shopping Cart

## Description of Repository:

  This Repo consists of the Module 19 exercises, the creation of a shopping cart on a produce isle.

## How to Use: 
  Click on what you want to add to your cart, expand on each item for details and a remove option. Click to restock. Theres a video on the directory as well.

## Roadmap of future improvements: 
  Integrating this onto my portifolio could be useful.
  Creating additional pages to pull from, rename Products to Produce, maybe have a frozen isle and a Meat & Fish page to pull from, so you would select from a list for "produce" or "frozen isle" instead of an open imput field. This would prevent issues like typing mistakes
